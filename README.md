Background
----------
The Vital Bracelet Arena app is going to be the new companion app for the Vital
Bracelet series of fitness bracelet toys, however the app does not support
account linking from VB Lab and VBC Lab, and requires you to transfer characters
one by one from those apps through your Vital Bracelet. Because the Vital
Bracelet can only hold at most two characters at a time and requires inserting
Dim/VBM to complete the transfer, transferring all of your characters may take
a significant amount of time. The VB Lab Migration Assistant is designed to make
this process faster by allowing you to store an unlimited amount of characters
on the Flipper and to bypass the Dim loading process, therefore allowing you to
transfer your characters without having to flip back and forth between the apps
or wasting time loading data that will never be used.

Usage
-----

### 1. Register Vital Bracelet

Registering your Vital Bracelet to the Flipper creates template data used for
emulating the VB using the Flipper.

1. Select "Register Vital Bracelet" from Migration Assistant's main menu.
2. If you have an active character on your Vital Bracelet, **transfer it to VB
   Lab**. The active character slot on the VB has to be empty to avoid issues
   when transferring character from VB Lab to the Flipper. Press the right key
   on Flipper.
3. If there is an active character in VB Lab, put it in storage.
4. On VB Lab's "Scan" page, tap "Vital Bracelet -> App". Press the right key on
   Flipper.
5. Tap the Flipper to your Vital Bracelet. You do not have to put the VB in
   scan mode. When Flipper finishes reading, it will beep.
6. On VB Lab, tap "Send", and tap the Flipper to your phone. VB Lab will give
   you an error message. This is normal, and you can dismiss it. The Flipper
   will beep. Wait for it to switch to the next screen.
7. Tap the Flipper to the original Vital Bracelet again. The Flipper will beep
   when it's finished reading.
8. Name the Vital Bracelet and select "Save".

The Vital Bracelet info will show after saving.

### 2. Select Vital Bracelet, Vital Bracelet Info

Use the "Select Vital Bracelet" menu to load a previously registered VB. After
loading, you will see information about this Vital Bracelet:

- Registered name
- Vital Bracelet type
- Number of characters captured

Press the right key to see a menu of options you can use with the registered VB.

### 3. Transfer App > Flipper

Use this mode to transfer characters from VB Lab to Flipper.

1. An instructions screen is displayed. Press right key to continue.
2. On your VB Lab app, wake up the character you want to send (if you have not
   already).
3. Go to the "Scan" screen, and tap "App -> Vital Bracelet". Select "Check Dim
   Card". If prompted to send Special Missions or items, tap "No".
4. Tap the Flipper to your phone. Release when VB Lab indicates to do so, and
   wait for Flipper to beep.
5. Tap "Check Dim Installation" on VB Lab, and tap Flipper to your phone.
   Flipper will beep.
6. Tap "Send" on VB Lab, and tap Flipper to your phone. Hold it there until VB
   Lab shows the transfer animation. Flipper will beep after it has received
   the character.
7. Tap "OK" on VB Lab. Flipper will have automatically reloaded the template so
   you can repeat from step 2 again to transfer more characters.
8. When you are done transferring characters, press the left key on Flipper to
   exit the transfer mode.

Note if you have previously transferred characters to Flipper, the new
characters you transfer will be put at the end of the sequence of characters
when transferring from Flipper to app.

### 4. Transfer Flipper > App

Use this mode to transfer characters from Flipper to VB Lab.

1. An instructions screen is displayed. Press right key to continue.
2. On your VB Lab app, if you have an active character, save the character into
   storage.
3. Go to the "Scan" screen, and tap "Vital Bracelet -> App".
4. Tap "Send". Tap your Flipper to your phone, and hold until VB Lab shows the
   transfer animation. Flipper will beep when it detected the transfer and will
   load the next character.
5. Repeat from step 2 until all of your characters have been transferred.
6. If you want to skip a certain character, press the right key to skip and load
   the next character.
7. You will see the "Transfers complete" screen on Flipper when all characters
   have been transferred. Press the right key to return to the menu.

### 5. Clear Captures

If you are doing transfers in batches, you can clear the currently captured
characters so you do not have to skip them when transferring to app. Check the
details, and press the right key to confirm deletion.

### 6. Delete Vital Bracelet

If you want to unregister the Vital Bracelet, you can use this option to delete
its captures and remove it from the "Select Vital Bracelet" list. Check the
details, and press the right key to confirm deletion.
